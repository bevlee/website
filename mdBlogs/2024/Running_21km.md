### Running 21km

One of my current goals is to run a marathon. The reasons I have this goal is:

- It is a bucket list item (that is easier to complete earlier in my life)
- I did some weightlifting and basketball but I wanted to improve my cardio health
- It is difficult

By coming up with clear goals and committing to it (I bought the ticket to the marathon 7 months in advance), I've set this in my head as something I will do. By not doubting that I can achieve this goal, I don't think about all the cases in which I might not reach it but instead consider how I CAN get there, no matter how difficult. As Kobe Bryant said, this is signing a contract with yourself and it is not negotiable.

For the half marathon I followed a simple training plan on Runners World and slowly increased my running distance up to the race with a lighter week leading up to the race. I ran about 4 days a week and I found the morning runs to be long but nice as they gave me time to think about life. I bought a large pack of Gu energy gels and used them in my practice runs.

The half marathon I ran was slightly disappointing as it was two laps around the city. I was able to run multiple half marathons in my training so I came into the race pretty confident. The run was pretty smooth and I was able to finish it in 1:44.

My routine of running has slowly increased from 5km to 20km runs and it has worked very well for me. I keep my workouts to be slightly outside of my comfort zone so it's uncomfortable but manageable. The key for me is not setting goals too far out and slowly increasing the length of my runs. I actually find it pretty easy to commit to running as I just wake up early from my alarm and jump right into it. I also don't have an easy way out during my runs as I have no choice but to run back to get home.
