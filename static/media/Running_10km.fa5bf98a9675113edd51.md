## Running 10km
I've never enjoyed doing cardio and I never thought I would get into long distance running. 

I initially got into running after a colleague recommended that I join a local parkrun. Parkruns are community run 5km routes that attract competitive runners all the way to casual walkers.
I kept a pretty active lifestyle doing light weightlifting/calisthenics and playing basketball a few times a week but nothing of the endurance nature. I ran my first parkrun in 32 minutes barely managing to run the whole duration. 

These experiences were not enjoyable at all. I had trouble keeping my breathing steady and it was hard on my legs to run for 30 minutes straight. Despite this, the social and competitive aspects got me to continue running at these weekly parkruns. I pretty much only ran once a week but gradually my times went down to the mid 20s. Before long, I bought myself a Garmin watch to collect some stats on my speed and heartrate over the course of the run. 

### A 10km run
A friend signed up for a 10km run but wasn't able to make it due to an injury so I decided I may as well give it a shot! I had only run up to 7km in one go before but was relatively confident about it. Given my 5km pace, it would take around an hour to run this - meaning that I'd need some additional energy to keep myself functioning for the whole run. The typical 5km run is short enough that no food or water is really required before or during the run. I did some quick research and found that the recommendation is to eat a big dinner the night before - supposedly a high card, low fat and low fiber meal. It was 11pm already so I had to scratch out that option. For breakfast i found results recommending:  
- fruits due to their sugar content (which is able to be quickly converted into energy for the body to use) and how quickly they digest
- carbohydrates as they become the primary fuel source for energy over fat for moderate/high intensity exercise
I woke up 2 hours before the run and ate a slice of bread, two eggs and a banana. Then I went back to sleep. 

It started raining as soon as I parked my car and I had a chat about it with a fellow runner on the walk over to the track. I remembered to get to the toilet just before the race and luckily it wasn't too busy as I hear it can get. I remember being overwhelemed with how many people were in the race as we lined up at the track. If people paid 80 to run and there 1000 runners, that would be a lot of money, also considering that the 10km isnt the only race (5km, 21km, 42km) and I presume it wasn't the most popular either. 

The rain wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was quite light and brought the temperature way down, making the run sort of relaxing.

Overall I found it pretty manageable, keeping enough energy the whole time to finish at a sprint. I went a bit too fast because after finishing, I nearly ran into someone walking ahead of me.
