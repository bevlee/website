# Blog 1

## The Beginning
This is the start of my blog journey.

I am a software developer who has struggled to finish a full project in my spare time. 
I have always been slightly motivated to try my hand at productivity apps, games or websites but never managed to see it through.
In this day, there are so many distractions and whether its social media, youtube or other hobbies, it's so easy for me to put a task down as soon as I encounter any resistance.


I've been reading a lot lately and it has opened my eyes to many ideas, especially 'Memento Mori' - a reminder that life is short and I could die anytime.  
Given that, I may as well put as much effort in as I can in working towards my goals.


### Documenting my Journey

The main purpose of this blog is to note down my thoughts and gain clarity in my ideas.
When I think about it critically, there are so many things that happen everyday in my life of note. 
Wouldn't it be great to dig deeper into them rather than forgetting about it as soon as something else exciting happens?


This blog is also written to keep track of my progress. This idea is inspired by Alex Hormozi on wishing that ultra successful CEO's like Bezos and Musk documented their journey for us to see.
I've had dreams of doing big things like creating an awesome video game or becoming a famous youtube musician. 
I realise that these dreams can only begin from small but persistent steps so here we go.

### How do I get started?

I wouldn't say that I've 'made it' in anything but I suspect that the key is to have a specific goal and then break it down into MANAGEBLE steps.

One of my current goals is to run a marathon. The reasons I have for this goals is:
- It is a bucket list item that I want to complete earlier in my life
- I did plenty of weightlifting/calisthenics as my exercise but I wanted to improve my cardio health
- It is difficult 

By coming up with clear goals and committing to it (I bought the ticket to the marathon 7 months in advance), I've set this in my head as something I will do.

I've then followed a simple training plan on runners world and have worked my way from barely being able to run 5km to running a half marathon in 1:44. My routine of running is slowly increasing from 5km to 20km runs in a progressive way has worked wonders for me. I keep my workouts to be slightly outside of my comfort zone so its uncomfortable but manageable. The key for me is not setting goals too far out like running 30km right after running 20km. 

This has been my issue with coding projects where I work on a complex game like chess and then when I inevitably hit a roadblock it becomes very difficult to push through. In this case, it would be a much better idea to start with a much simpler game like Tic Tac Toe.
