## The Beginning

Writing blogs is not new or novel. The barrier to entry has been significantly lowered with blogging platforms and easier website hosting (like github pages) and this will no dobut continue as technology improves and becomes more accessible.

It is something new to me though - I hope to learn more about communicating ideas more efficiently through blogging.

The main purpose of this blog is to note down my thoughts and gain clarity in my ideas. When I think about it, every single day there are so many interesting things that happen. Wouldn't it be great to dig deeper into them rather than forgetting about it as soon as the next exciting happens?

This blog is also written to keep track of my progress. This idea is inspired by Alex Hormozi on wishing that ultra successful CEO's like Bezos and Musk documented their journey for us to see. I've had dreams of doing big things like creating an awesome video game or becoming a famous youtube musician. I realise that these dreams can only begin from small but persistent steps so here we go.

Stay tuned for more
