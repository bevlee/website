## Running 10km
I've never enjoyed doing cardio and I never thought I would run 21km (13mi). 

I initially got into running after a colleague recommended that I join a local parkrun. Parkruns are community run 5km routes that attract competitive runners all the way to casual walkers.
I kept a pretty active lifestyle doing light weightlifting/calisthenics and playing basketball a few times a week but nothing of the endurance nature. I ran my first parkrun in 32 minutes barely managing to run the whole duration. 

These experiences were not enjoyable at all. I had trouble keeping my breathing steady and it was hard on my legs to run for 30 minutes straight. Despite this, the social and competitive aspects got me to continue running at these weekly parkruns. I pretty much only ran once a week but gradually my times went down to the mid 20s. Before long, I bought myself a Garmin watch to collect some stats on my speed and heartrate over the course of the run. 

### A 10km run
A friend signed up for a 10km run but wasn't able to make it due to an injury so I decided I may as well give it a shot! I had only run up to 7km in one go before but was relatively confident about it. Given my 5km pace, it would take around an hour to run this - meaning that I'd need some additional energy to keep myself functioning for the whole run. The typical 5km run is short enough that no food or water is really required before or during the run. I did some quick research and found that the recommendation is to eat a big dinner the night before - supposedly a high card, low fat and low fiber meal. It was 11pm already so I had to scratch out that option. For breakfast i found results recommending:  
- fruits due to their sugar content (which is able to be quickly converted into energy for the body to use) and how quickly they digest
- carbohydrates as they become the primary fuel source for energy over fat for moderate/high intensity exercise
I woke up 2 hours before the run and ate a slice of bread, two eggs and a banana. Then I went back to sleep. 

It started raining as soon as I parked my car and I had a chat about it with a fellow runner on the walk over to the track. I remembered to get to the toilet just before the race and luckily it wasn't too busy as I hear it can get. I remember being overwhelemed with how many people were in the race as we lined up at the track. If people paid 80 to run and there 1000 runners, that would be a lot of money, also considering that the 10km isnt the only race (5km, 21km, 42km) and I presume it wasn't the most popular either. 

Overall I found it pretty manageable, keeping enough energy the whole time to finish at a sprint. I went a bit too fast because after finishing, I nearly ran into someone walking ahead of me.
### How do I get started?

The key is to have a specific goal and then break it down into MANAGEBLE steps.

One of my current goals is to run a marathon. The reasons I have for this goals is:
- It is a bucket list item that I want to complete earlier in my life
- I did plenty of weightlifting/calisthenics as my exercise but I wanted to improve my cardio health
- It is difficult 

By coming up with clear goals and committing to it (I bought the ticket to the marathon 7 months in advance), I've set this in my head as something I will do.

I've then followed a simple training plan on runners world and have worked my way from barely being able to run 5km to running a half marathon in 1:44. My routine of running is slowly increasing from 5km to 20km runs in a progressive way has worked wonders for me. I keep my workouts to be slightly outside of my comfort zone so its uncomfortable but manageable. The key for me is not setting goals too far out like running 30km right after running 20km. 

This has been my issue with coding projects where I work on a complex game like chess and then when I inevitably hit a roadblock it becomes very difficult to push through. In this case, it would be a much better idea to start with a much simpler game like Tic Tac Toe.



I am a software developer who has struggled to finish a side project despite coming up with many ideas. 
I have always been slightly motivated to try my hand at productivity apps, games or websites but never managed to see it through.
In this day, there are so many distractions and whether its social media, youtube or other hobbies, it's so easy for me to put a task down as soon as I encounter any resistance.


I've been reading a lot of books lately and it has opened my eyes to many ideas, especially 'Memento Mori' - a reminder that life is short and I could die anytime.  
Given that, I may as well put as much effort in as I can in working towards my goals.
### Documenting my Journey

The main purpose of this blog is to note down my thoughts and gain clarity in my ideas.
When I think about it critically, there are so many things that happen everyday in my life of note. 
Wouldn't it be great to dig deeper into them rather than forgetting about it as soon as something else exciting happens?


This blog is also written to keep track of my progress. This idea is inspired by Alex Hormozi on wishing that ultra successful CEO's like Bezos and Musk documented their journey for us to see.
I've had dreams of doing big things like creating an awesome video game or becoming a famous youtube musician. 
I realise that these dreams can only begin from small but persistent steps so here we go.
